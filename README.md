# ccc-2020
The project i submitted for 2020 Computer Club Competition (CCC). This competition was rolled by the computer club of my college, hence the name. The participants were chosen by the committee from [CCTS](https://github.com/aintyourcat/ccts-2020)'s. We assigned to create our own portfolio. I didn't win. Nevertheless, it's such a great opportunity!
